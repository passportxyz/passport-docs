# Package Manager Convention

## Rule

**Always use pnpm, not npm.**

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install    # Install dependencies
pnpm dev        # Run dev server
```

## Details

This project uses pnpm as its package manager. The package.json doesn't have a packageManager field but CLAUDE.md explicitly states to use pnpm.
