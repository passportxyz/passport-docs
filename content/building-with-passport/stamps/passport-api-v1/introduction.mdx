# Stamps API v1

<Callout type="warning">
**Please note:**<br />In November 2024, we soft-launched [Stamps API v2](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api).<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, but do strongly recommend using v2 moving forward.<br /><br />You can learn more about the differences between v1 and v2 via our [migration guide](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/migrate).
