# SoulBound Tokens (Legacy)

<Callout type="warning">
**EVM SBTs are legacy.** On EVM chains, SBTs have been replaced by attestations via Sign Protocol. For new EVM integrations, use the [API Reference](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/api-reference) or [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols).

**Stellar SBTs are current.** On Stellar, SBTs via Soroban are the active integration method. See the [Stellar Integration](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains/stellar) page for complete details.
</Callout>

SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) are non-transferable tokens that were the original method for recording Individual Verifications on-chain. While SBTs are still issued for backward compatibility, attestations are now the primary verification record.

## Overview

SBTs are:
- **Non-transferable**: Cannot be sent to another address
- **Tied to identity**: Represent a verified individual
- **Time-limited**: Expire after 1 year and must be renewed

## When to Use SBTs

Consider querying SBTs only if:
- You have an existing integration that depends on SBT contracts
- You need to verify historical verifications issued before the attestation migration

For all new integrations, use [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols) instead.

## Contract Addresses

### Optimism (EVM)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| Hub V3 | `0x2AA822e264F8cc31A2b9C22f39e5551241e94DfB` |

### Optimism Sepolia (Testnet)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| Hub V3 | `0x71712Ac158C5b25519Aad43eB9f496ae16892211` |

### Stellar (Soroban)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| SBT Contract | `CCNTHEVSWNDOQAMXXHFOLQIXWUINUPTJIM6AXFSKODNVXWA4N7XV3AI5` |

---

## SBT Status Codes

All chains use consistent status codes when querying SBTs:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `valid` | SBT exists and is active |
| `expired` | SBT has passed its expiration date (1 year from issuance) |
| `revoked` | SBT has been revoked |
| `none` | No SBT found for this address |

## Querying SBTs on Stellar

For complete Stellar SBT querying examples (TypeScript and Soroban/Rust), see the [Stellar Integration](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains/stellar#querying-sbts) page.

---

## Circuit IDs

Different verification types use different circuit IDs when querying SBTs:

| Verification Type | Circuit ID |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Government ID (KYC)** | `0x729d660e1c02e4e419745e617d643f897a538673ccf1051e093bbfa58b0a120b` |
| **Phone** | `0xbce052cf723dca06a21bd3cf838bc518931730fb3db7859fc9cc86f0d5483495` |
| **Biometrics** | `0x0b5121226395e3b6c76eb8ddfb0bf2f2075e7f2c6956567e84b38a223c3a3d15` |
| **ePassport** | `0xf2ce248b529343e105f7b3c16459da619281c5f81cf716d28f7df9f87667364d` |

## Migration to Attestations

If you have an existing SBT integration, we recommend migrating to attestations:

1. **API users**: No changes needed - the API will automatically use attestations
2. **Direct contract queries**: Switch to [Sign Protocol queries](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols)

For migration assistance, [contact us](https://tally.so/r/3X81KL).
