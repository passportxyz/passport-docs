# Action IDs

Action IDs enable sybil resistance by enforcing the principle of "1 person = 1 action" - whether that's one vote, one airdrop claim, or one account per verified individual.

## Default Action ID

By default, Individual Verifications use a global action ID (`123456789`) that provides universal uniqueness across all applications. This means:

- A user can only verify one address as unique across **all** applications using the default ID
- This provides the strongest sybil resistance
- **Recommended for most use cases**

When querying the API, use the default action ID:

```bash
curl 'https://api.holonym.io/sybil-resistance/gov-id/optimism?user={address}&action-id=123456789'
```

## Custom Action IDs

For specific use cases requiring app-specific uniqueness (e.g., multiple elections where users need different addresses for privacy), custom action IDs are available.
