# Custom Action IDs

Action IDs enable custom sybil resistance for specific use cases. By default, Individual Verifications use a global action ID (`123456789`) that provides universal uniqueness across all applications. Custom action IDs allow you to create app-specific uniqueness proofs.

## Understanding Sybil Resistance

Sybil resistance enforces the principle of "1 person = 1 x", where x represents any scarce resource or action:

- 1 person = 1 vote (governance)
- 1 person = 1 airdrop allocation (token distribution)
- 1 person = 1 account (spam prevention)
- 1 person = 1 player (gaming fairness)
- 1 person = 1 matching contribution (quadratic funding)

## Default vs Custom Action IDs

### Default Action ID (`123456789`)

The default action ID provides **global uniqueness**. When a user verifies with the default action ID:

- They can only verify one address as unique across **all** applications using the default ID
- This provides the strongest sybil resistance
- Recommended for most use cases

### Custom Action IDs

Custom action IDs provide **app-specific uniqueness**. A user who has verified with another application can still verify as unique within your application, while being prevented from verifying twice within your application.

**Use cases for custom action IDs:**

- Multiple elections where users should vote from different addresses to preserve voting privacy
- Separate airdrops or campaigns that should allow the same user to participate from different addresses
- Multi-tenant platforms where each tenant needs independent uniqueness

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
Custom action IDs reduce the cost of bribery attacks. Consider these tradeoffs carefully before implementation.
</Callout>

**With the default action ID:** Bribery is expensive because giving up your uniqueness means giving up access to all future airdrops, governance participation, and other benefits across all applications.

**With custom action IDs:** A user who doesn't care about a specific vote outcome could provide a new address for that particular action ID. A malicious actor could:
1. Create many new addresses
2. Bribe users to register those addresses for the specific action ID
3. Since users don't care about that particular outcome, they accept the bribe

For most applications, we recommend using the default action ID unless you have a specific need for app-specific uniqueness.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Generate an Action ID

Create a unique numeric action ID for your application. Use a large random number less than the bn254 scalar field order:

```
21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617
```

For example, your action ID might be `11223344556677889900`.

### Step 2: Verify User Uniqueness

Query the API with your custom action ID to check if a user is unique for your specific application:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  'https://api.holonym.io/sybil-resistance/gov-id/optimism?user={address}&action-id={your-action-id}'
```

```json
{
  "result": true,
  "expirationDate": 1770922106
}
```

- If `result` is `true`, the user has verified uniqueness for your custom action ID
- If `result` is `false`, the user has not yet verified for this specific action ID

See the [API Reference](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/api-reference) for complete endpoint documentation.

Custom action ID verification requires users to complete a separate verification flow. Contact the [Human Passport team](https://t.me/+Mcp9RsRV7tVmYjZh) for guidance on implementing custom action ID verification flows for your application.

## Best Practices

1. **Default to the global action ID** - Use `123456789` unless you have a specific need for custom uniqueness
2. **Document your action ID** - Store your action ID securely and consistently across your application
3. **Consider the threat model** - Evaluate whether the reduced bribery resistance is acceptable for your use case
4. **Combine with other signals** - For high-stakes applications, consider combining Individual Verifications with [Passport Stamps](/building-with-passport/stamps) for additional sybil resistance
