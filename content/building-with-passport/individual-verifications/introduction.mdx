# Individual Verifications

Individual Verifications are privacy-preserving identity checks that use zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to prove facts about themselves without revealing their full identity.

Unlike [Stamps-based verification](/building-with-passport/stamps), which aggregates multiple signals into a composite score, Individual Verifications provide specific, targeted proofs such as government ID verification, phone number uniqueness, or biometric liveness checks.

## Available Verification Types

| Verification | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| **Government ID (KYC)** | Verify identity via government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, national ID) | [id.human.tech/gov-id](https://id.human.tech/gov-id) |
| **Phone** | Verify a unique phone number | [id.human.tech/phone](https://id.human.tech/phone) |
| **Biometrics** | Non-identifying face uniqueness and liveness check | [id.human.tech/biometrics](https://id.human.tech/biometrics) |
| **Proof of Clean Hands** | Sanctions and PEP list verification (AML compliance) | [id.human.tech/clean-hands](https://id.human.tech/clean-hands) |

### Sandbox Environment

For testing and development, sandbox versions are available:

| Verification | Sandbox Link |
|--------------|--------------|
| Government ID (KYC) | [id.human.tech/sandbox/gov-id](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/gov-id) |
| Phone | [id.human.tech/sandbox/phone](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/phone) |
| Proof of Clean Hands | [id.human.tech/sandbox/clean-hands](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/clean-hands) |
| Biometrics | Coming soon |

## Supported Chains

Individual Verifications issue SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on multiple chains:

- **Optimism** - Primary chain with full verification support
- **Stellar** - Soroban smart contract integration

See the [Supported Chains](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains) page for integration details.

## Key Benefits

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove facts without revealing underlying data
- **Sybil Resistant**: SBTs are non-transferable and tied to verified individuals
- **Regulatory Compliant**: Built-in KYC/AML capabilities for compliance requirements
- **Cross-Chain**: Verify once, prove across multiple blockchain networks

## How It Works

1. **Issuance**: User completes verification (e.g., government ID scan) with an identity verification provider
2. **Credential Creation**: A privacy-preserving credential is created and stored client-side
3. **Proof Generation**: User generates zero-knowledge proofs to prove specific facts
4. **On-Chain Verification**: Proofs can be verified on-chain via SBT contracts
5. **Renewal**: SBTs expire after 1 year and must be renewed to maintain valid verification status
