# Individual Verifications

Individual Verifications let users complete identity checks once and reuse them across any integrated application. Powered by zero-knowledge proofs, verifications are privacy-preserving — apps learn that a user passed KYC, not their name or ID number.

Unlike [Stamps-based verification](/building-with-passport/stamps), which aggregates multiple signals into a composite score, Individual Verifications provide specific, targeted proofs such as government ID verification, phone number uniqueness, or biometric liveness checks.

**Choosing the right verification approach**

Human Passport offers multiple verification methods:
- **[Stamps](/building-with-passport/stamps)** - Aggregate multiple signals into a composite score. Best for general Sybil resistance.
- **[Models](/building-with-passport/models)** - ML-powered scoring with zero user friction. Best for frictionless verification.
- **[Individual Verifications](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications)** - Privacy-preserving KYC, phone, biometrics, and AML checks. Best for regulatory compliance or stronger identity guarantees.
</Callout>

## Why Individual Verifications?

|  | Traditional KYC | Individual Verifications |
|--|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Data shared** | Full PII (name, ID number, address) | Only pass/fail — zero personal data |
| **Reusability** | Verify separately per app | Verify once, reuse everywhere |
| **Compliance** | Varies by provider | Built-in KYC and AML (Clean Hands) |
| **User experience** | Minutes of forms per app | One-time verification + instant reuse |
| **Sybil resistance** | Depends on implementation | Built-in — attestations are tied to verified individuals |

## How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work

1. **Verification**: The user completes an identity check (e.g., government ID scan) with an identity verification provider.
2. **Credential creation**: A cryptographic credential is created and stored client-side. Personal data never leaves the user's device.
3. **Proof generation**: When an app needs proof, the user generates a ZK proof — a compact cryptographic certificate that proves "I passed KYC" without revealing any underlying data.
4. **On-chain attestation**: The proof is verified and recorded on-chain as an attestation via [Sign Protocol](https://sign.global/) (on Optimism/Base) or as an SBT on Stellar.

<Callout type="tip">
Think of it like a bouncer checking your ID at a bar. The bouncer confirms you're over 21, but the bar never sees your name, address, or birthdate. ZKPs work the same way — cryptographic proof of a fact, with zero personal data disclosed.
</Callout>

Each verification type (Gov ID, Phone, Biometrics, Clean Hands) uses a different ZK circuit — a specific proof program. See [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols) for circuit and schema IDs.

## Available Verification Types

| Verification | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| **Government ID (KYC)** | Verify identity via government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, national ID) | [id.human.tech/gov-id](https://id.human.tech/gov-id) |
| **Phone** | Verify a unique phone number | [id.human.tech/phone](https://id.human.tech/phone) |
| **Biometrics** | Non-identifying face uniqueness and liveness check | [id.human.tech/biometrics](https://id.human.tech/biometrics) |
| **Proof of Clean Hands** | Sanctions and PEP list verification (AML compliance) | [id.human.tech/clean-hands](https://id.human.tech/clean-hands) |


### Sandbox Environment

For testing and development, sandbox versions are available:

| Verification | Sandbox Link |
|--------------|--------------|
| Government ID (KYC) | [id.human.tech/sandbox/gov-id](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/gov-id) |
| Phone | [id.human.tech/sandbox/phone](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/phone) |
| Proof of Clean Hands | [id.human.tech/sandbox/clean-hands](https://id.human.tech/sandbox/clean-hands) |
| Biometrics | Coming soon |

## Supported Chains

Individual Verifications issue attestations via [Sign Protocol](https://sign.global/) on multiple chains:

- **Optimism** - Primary chain with full verification support
- **Base** - Clean Hands and Biometrics attestations
- **Stellar** - Soroban smart contract integration (Gov ID, Phone) — [Stellar Integration](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains/stellar)

See the [Supported Chains](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains) page for chain-specific details.

## Basic Integration Flow

### Quickstart: Check if a user is KYC-verified

A single API call checks whether an address has a valid verification:

```bash
curl 'https://api.holonym.io/sybil-resistance/gov-id/optimism?user=USER_ADDRESS&action-id=123456789'
```

```json
// Verified user
{ "result": true, "expirationDate": 1770922106 }

// Not verified
{ "result": false }
```

That's it — one API call. For on-chain verification, query Sign Protocol attestations directly. See [API Reference](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/api-reference) for all endpoints or [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols) for on-chain queries.

## Integration Options

Choose the integration method that best fits your use case:

| Use Case | Method | Description |

| **On-chain contracts** | [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols) | Query Sign Protocol attestations directly |
| **Client-side dApps** | [SDK Integration](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/sdk) | Embed verification flows in your application |
| **Stellar integration** | [Stellar Integration](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/supported-chains/stellar) | Query SBTs on Stellar via Soroban |
