# Supported Chains

Individual Verifications issue attestations on multiple blockchain networks, allowing users to verify once and prove their identity across different ecosystems.

## Overview

| Chain | Gov ID | Phone | Biometrics | Clean Hands |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Optimism** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Base** | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Stellar** | ✅ | ✅ | - | - |

## How Multi-Chain Verification Works

1. **Single Verification**: User completes identity verification once (KYC, phone, biometrics, etc.)
2. **Chain Selection**: User chooses which blockchain to receive their attestation
3. **Attestation Issuance**: A Sign Protocol attestation is issued on the selected chain
4. **Cross-dApp Usage**: The attestation can be verified by any application on that chain

<Callout type="tip">
For enhanced privacy, users can pay verification fees from a different wallet than the one receiving the attestation. This prevents timing correlation attacks.
</Callout>

## Optimism

Optimism is the primary chain for Individual Verifications, with full support for all verification types.

**Supported Verifications:**
- Government ID (KYC)
- Phone
- Biometrics
- Proof of Clean Hands

### Sign Protocol Configuration (Optimism)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Schema ID | `onchain_evm_10_0x1` |
| Attester | `0xB1f50c6C34C72346b1229e5C80587D0D659556Fd` |
| Chain ID | 10 |

### Querying Attestations on Optimism

```bash
curl 'https://mainnet-rpc.sign.global/api/index/attestations?schemaId=onchain_evm_10_0x1&attester=0xB1f50c6C34C72346b1229e5C80587D0D659556Fd'
```

For complete query examples and validation code, see [Attestation Protocols](/building-with-passport/individual-verifications/major-concepts/attestation-protocols).

## Base

Base supports Biometrics and Proof of Clean Hands attestations.

**Supported Verifications:**
- Biometrics
- Proof of Clean Hands

### Sign Protocol Configuration (Base)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Schema ID | `onchain_evm_10_0x8` |
| Attester | `0xB1f50c6C34C72346b1229e5C80587D0D659556Fd` |
| Chain ID | 8453 |

## Stellar

Individual Verifications support Stellar via Soroban smart contracts for Government ID and Phone verifications.

**Supported Verifications:**
- Government ID (KYC)
- Phone

### User Flow

1. Visit the verification page for the desired verification type
2. Complete the verification process
3. Enter a Stellar address to receive the verification
4. The verification is recorded on Stellar

<Callout type="info">
For Stellar-specific integration details and code examples, see the [Stellar Documentation](https://zeronym-docs.holonym.id/stellar).
</Callout>

## Sandbox / Testnet

For testing and development, use Base Sepolia testnet.

### Sign Protocol Configuration (Sandbox)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Schema ID | `onchain_evm_11155420_0xc41` |
| API Endpoint | `https://testnet-rpc.sign.global/api/index/attestations` |
| Chain ID | 11155420 (Optimism Sepolia) |

### Sandbox Verification URLs

| Verification | Sandbox URL |
|--------------|-------------|
| Government ID | `https://id.human.tech/gov-id?sandbox=true` |
| Phone | `https://id.human.tech/phone?sandbox=true` |
| Biometrics | `https://id.human.tech/biometrics?sandbox=true` |
