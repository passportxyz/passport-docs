# Installation

This guide covers installing the Passport Embed package and rendering the widget in your React application.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:
- A React application (v18+)
- Your **Embed API key** and **Scorer ID** from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.passport.xyz)

If you don't have credentials yet, follow the [getting access guide](getting-access) to generate them.

## Install the Package

Add the Passport Embed package to your project:

```bash
npm install @human.tech/passport-embed@latest
```

or

```bash
yarn add @human.tech/passport-embed@latest
```

## Basic Setup

Import and render the `PassportScoreWidget` component:

```jsx
import { PassportScoreWidget, DarkTheme } from "@human.tech/passport-embed";

const EMBED_API_KEY = "<YOUR_EMBED_API_KEY>";
const SCORER_ID = "<YOUR_SCORER_ID>";

function MyPage() {
  // Your wallet connection logic provides userAddress
  const userAddress = "0x...";

  const signMessage = async (message: string): Promise<string> => {
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
    return await window.ethereum.request({
      method: "personal_sign",
      params: [message, accounts[0]]
    });
  };

  return (
    <PassportScoreWidget
      apiKey={EMBED_API_KEY}
      scorerId={SCORER_ID}
      address={userAddress}
      generateSignatureCallback={signMessage}
      theme={DarkTheme}
    />
  );
}
```
