## Developer Products and Services

### Passport Stamps

Passport Stamps is the core product of Human Passport, and the primary way to verify a user's identity and trustworthiness. 

With Passport Stamps, users can choose how they prove their unique humanity by verifying different Stamps, or verifiable credentials, which represent high human signal activities throughout web3 and web2. Users can choose to verify with KYC, biometrics, web3 activity, web of trust, and web2 activity Stamps to build up a score, which can then be used by builders to protect access or classify addresses.

Passport Stamps data is made available via the [Stamps API](./building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api). Users can optionally push their Passport Stamps data onchain, which can be accessed by developers using our [smart contracts](./building-with-passport/stamps/smart-contracts).

The core Passport Stamps and Passport Embed offerings are free, but additional [customizations](./building-with-passport/stamps/custom-passport.mdx) can be added to your integration to reduce user friction and brand the unique human verification experience.

### Passport Embed

Passport Embed is an embeddable React component that enables you to add Passport's Stamps-based verification directly on your website or dApp, ensuring that users can verify their identity without having to leave the protected user flow.

### Passport Models

Passport Models is a real-time verification product that enables you to classify any EVM address as Sybil or human, without requiring users to have a Passport Stamps account. It offers reduced user friction and provides a quick way to verify addresses. 

The model scores made available by the [Models API](/building-with-passport/models) are generated using Human Passport's machine learning models that analyze address onchain activity on ETH L1 and several L2s, and compares that activity against the activity of massive lists of known Sybils and humans. 

Passport Models can be used as a quick primary verification method for your community to pass high-quality users. It can also be used alongside Passport Stamps, enabling an frictionless experience to those that pass the Models check, and a secondary verification option with the Stamp-based verification system.

### Individual Verifications

Individual Verifications provide privacy-preserving identity checks using zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike Stamps-based verification which aggregates multiple signals into a composite score, Individual Verifications offer specific, targeted proofs for use cases requiring stronger identity guarantees.

Available verification types include:
- **Government ID (KYC)** - Verify identity via government-issued ID
- **Phone** - Verify a unique phone number
- **Biometrics** - Face uniqueness and liveness check
- **Proof of Clean Hands** - Sanctions and PEP list verification (AML compliance)

Individual Verifications issue non-transferable SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on Optimism and Stellar.

### Data services

Human Passport also offers data services to partners who need to better understand whether a list of addresses is Sybil or human. 

These data services include the following types of analyses for each address provided:
* Sybil classification using Passport Models
* Sybil clustering analysis
* Diamond hands analysis
* Custom analysis requested by specific partners

As part of these engagements, the Passport data team will provide actionable recommendations, as well as embed with your team to make sure you know how to use the data services effectively.
