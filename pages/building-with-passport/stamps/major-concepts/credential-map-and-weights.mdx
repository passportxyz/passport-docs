# Credential Map and Weights

The Stamp-based realtime verification product uses a set of Stamps and underlying weighted credentials to determine the Unique Humanity Score of a user.

## Stamps and credentials 

Each Stamp partner or concept has their own Stamp that users can see and interact with see in their Passport. Each Stamp can have one or multiple underlying weighted credentials, which represent an identity verification activity within the Stamp partner's ecosystem.

The weights assigned to each credential represent how strong of a human signal the underlying verification activity represents. The higher the point allocation to a credential, the better the human signal.

## Customizations

If you'd like to customize these credentials, you can do so with [Custom Passport](/building-with-passport/stamps/custom-passport)

Custom Passport enables you to customize the Passport Stamp lineup around your ecosystem's unique needs. You can make the following adjustments:
- Remove Stamps that don't fit your needs
- Adjust the weights of existing Stamps
- Create your own allowlist-based or GitHub activity-based Stamps

If you're interested in learning more about how to customize the Passport Stamp lineup, please reach out to us via this [form](https://tally.so/r/3X81KL).

## Credential Map and Weights

The following table will help you understand how to map the different available credentials to their corresponding Stamps and weights. It is sorted based on the Stamp, orderred highest points to least.
