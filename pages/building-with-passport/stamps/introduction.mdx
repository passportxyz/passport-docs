# Passport Stamps

Passport Stamps are a way to collect and present data without exposing it or giving up ownership. 

## What are Stamps?

Passport Stamps is an aggregate, real-time verification tool that can enable users to prove their unique humanity using a variety of different verification methods, and for developers to access these humanity proofs via the [Passport API](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/overview) or [smart contracts](/building-with-passport/stamps/smart-contracts/overview).

**Verified Credentials do not contain any personal identifying information!** They simply demonstrate, using a cryptographic signature, that the user gave access to a specific app and that some criteria were met. Learn more about how Human Passport is [privacy preserving](https://passport.human.tech/privacy).

## Use cases

Developers can integrate Passport in a variety of different programs and apps in the web3 ecosystem, as demonstrated by the following use case examples:

- Sybil resistance for faucets, bundlers and airdrops
- Gating access to content, events, polls, or communities
- Priority weighting votes
- Proving trustworthiness

Passport Stamps is a versatile and valuable tool for managing access, promoting transparency, and establishing trust within different web3 environments.

## Available developer tools

Passport score and Stamp data can be retrieved in two ways:

* **[Passport API v2](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/overview):** Retrieves the Stamp-based Unique Humanity Score and associated metadata for a specified address.

* **[Custom Passport](/building-with-passport/custom-passport):** A dashboard that can be customized to the unique needs of your ecosystem.
