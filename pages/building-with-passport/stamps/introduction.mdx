# Introduction

If youâ€™re a Human Passport user interested in setting up a Passport and connecting Stamps to it, head to our [support site](https://support.passport.xyz) for more info.

## What is Passport?

Passport is a tool that allows users to present evidence that they are real, unique humans and signal their trustworthiness to apps. It is a way to collect and present data without exposing it or giving up ownership. 

Under the hood, it is a unique decentralized identifier (a DID) associated with your Ethereum address, stored on the Ceramic network. 

The DID can be used to look up a user's Stamp data, which exists as a collection of Verified Credentials.

**Verified Credentials do not contain any personal identifying information!** They simply demonstrate, using a cryptographic signature, that the user gave access to a specific app and that some criteria were met.

## Use cases

Developers can integrate Passport in a variety of different programs and apps in the web3 ecosystem, as demonstrated by the following use case examples:

- Sybil resistance for faucets, bundlers and airdrops
- Gating access to content, events, polls, or communities
- Priority weighting votes
- Proving trustworthiness

Passport is a versatile and valuable tool for managing access, promoting transparency, and establishing trust within different web3 environments.

## Available developer tools

Passport score and Stamp data can be retrieved in two ways:

* **Passport API v2:** Retrieves the Stamp-based Unique Humanity Score and associated metadata for a specified address. 
* **Models API:** This API is currently in beta. Retrieves the Model Based Detection Score for a specified address.
* **Passport Smart Contracts:** Interacts with a blockchain to retrieve Stamp-based Unique Humanity Scores associated with a specific address. 

### Passport API v2

The Passport API v2 serves as a powerful tool for developers, offering access to Passport scores and Stamps via several REST endpoints.

**Please note:**<br />In November 2024, we soft-launched [Passport API v2](../passport-api/overview).<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, but do strongly recommend using v2 moving forward.<br /><br />You can learn more about the differences between v1 and v2 via our [migration guide](migrate).

### Custom Passport

Custom Passport enables partners to develop a Human Passport dashboard that is customized to the unique needs of their ecosystem. This offering enables several additional features above and beyond what is offered on the standard Passport app, which can enable tailored proof of humanity solutions.
