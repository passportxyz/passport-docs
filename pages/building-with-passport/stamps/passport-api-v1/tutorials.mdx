<Callout type="warning">
**Please note:**<br />In November 2024, we soft-launched [Stamps API v2](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api).<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, but do strongly recommend using v2 moving forward.<br /><br />We are actively working on updating the v1 tutorials to use v2.<br /><br />You can learn more about the differences between v1 and v2 via our [migration guide](migrate).

## Where to start

If you are taking your first steps into building apps with the Stamps API, please make sure to use [Stamps API v2](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api). All of the below tutorials are still using v1 of the API.

If you need additional support or you have questions about developing with Passport, you can chat in our dedicated developer support channel on [Telegram](https://t.me/+Mcp9RsRV7tVmYjZh).


## Tutorials

### Gating access with Passport scores

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple "knowledge hub" app with some specific content that can only be accessed by users with a Passport score above a threshold.
Read more about thresholds on the [scoring thresholds](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds) page.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

### Integrating Stamps and scores

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple app that shows whether a user is "trusted" or not based upon their Passport score and ownership of specific Stamps. Multiple users can connect to the app and the Stamps they own are displayed in the app's UI.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

### Requiring a Passport score for airdrop claim

This guide demonstrates using Passport scores to shield your airdrop from airdrop farmers and other bad actors.

This app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation), and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/).

### How to integrate onchain Passport data using smart contracts

_Please note that this tutorial is not related to the Stamps API, and instead uses the Passport smart contract stack._

This tutorial will guide you how to show different content to users depending on their Passport data, all pulled from the blockchain.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).
