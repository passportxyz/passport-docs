# Data dictionary

<Callout type="warning">
**Please note:**<br />In November 2024, we soft-launched [Passport API v2](../passport-api/overview).<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, but do strongly recommend using v2 moving forward.<br /><br />You can learn more about the differences between v1 and v2 via our [migration guide](migrate).

On this page you will find definitions and explanations for the data types used in the Human Passport stack. The `Scorer`, `Stamp` , `Credential` and `Stamp-metadata` objects require the most explanation so they are handled separately here. Other types found across the Passport stack are defined in "Other data".

### The Scorer object

| `score`                | `string`          | The `registry/score` endpoint returns a `string` that should be parsed as a `float`. It represents the result of adding the weights of all a user's Stamps.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Returned from `registry/score`. Can be used to gate access to content.                                                                              |

| `expiration_date`      | `datetime string` | The date and time that the next upcoming Stamp will expire, which will subsequently reduce the `score`. To see when each specific Stamp expires, please use the [GET /stamps](api-reference#retrieve-stamps-verified-by-a-single-address) endpoint.                                                                                                                                | You might want to display this score expiration to the user to remind them to return to the Passport app to refresh their score before it expires   |
| `evidence`             | `struct`          | When the [binary Scorer](/building-with-passport/getting-access#types-of-scorers) is selected, this field is used to explain why the return value was 0 or 1. Specifically, the returned data shows the threshold score required to return 1, and the actual score the Passport received. The current score threshold for a passing score is 20. | You can use this to check the reasoning behind a binary Passport score, and understand why a Passport was decided to be Sybil (0) or non-Sybil (1). |
| `error`                | `string`          | Describes any error returned by the server.

| `stamp_scores`         | `struct`          | Contains key:value pairs with stamp names as keys and their weights for the scoring algoithm as values.                                    |
