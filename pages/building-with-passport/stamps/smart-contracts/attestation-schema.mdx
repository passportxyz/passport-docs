# Attestation schema

Onchain Passports use Attestations to verify that a particular address owns specific Stamps.
Ultimately, an Attestation is just a piece of data with a cryptographic signature. 

The data follows a known structure, known as a 'schema'. The  schema is critical because it ensures the signing participant
knows what they are signing, and provides a uniform data layout that enables users to decode the Attestations.

The schema is *the layout of information being attested*. 
The signature is the proof that a known, trusted verifier has seen the data and attested that it is truthful.

There is currently a single attestation written when users mint their Passports onchain, the Human Passport attestation.

## Human Passport attestation schema

[Human Attestation Schema on EAS](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xda0257756063c891659fed52fd36ef7557f7b45d66f59645fd3c3b263b747254)

The raw schema looks as follows:

```
bool passing_score, uint8 score_decimals, uint128 scorer_id, uint32 score, uint32 threshold, tuple(string provider, uint256 score)[] stamps
```

You can see an example Human Passport attestation on the Optimism network by visiting the following link:

### Fields

The fields in the Human Passport attestation are as follows:

- `passing_score` (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether the address's score meets or exceeds the threshold value. 
- `score_decimals` (uint8): The number of decimal places used for score precision. Set to `4`
- `scorer_id` (uint128): A unique identifier for the scoring algorithm instance. 
- `score` (uint32): The raw numerical score calculated for the address. 
- `threshold` (uint32): The minimum score required to achieve a passing grade. Default is set to `200000`, the recommendation from the Passport team. However, this can be updated by partners who have set a custom threshold using Custom Passport.
- `stamps` (tuple[]): An array of tuples containing verified credentials and their weights, where each tuple contains:
  - A string representing the stamp provider/type (e.g., "CoinbaseDualVerification2", "HolonymGovIdProvider")
  - A uint256 representing the weight/score contribution to the overall score

Example raw data:
```solidity
{
    passing_score: true,
    score_decimals: 4,
    scorer_id: 335,
    score: 922910,
    threshold: 200000,
    stamps: [
        ["CoinbaseDualVerification2", 100420],
        ["HolonymGovIdProvider", 160260],
        ["githubContributionActivityGte#60", 18880]
        // ... additional stamps
    ]
}
```

## Accessing User Attestation Data

To access a user's attestation data, please use the decoder contract, which is documented via the [contract reference](/building-with-passport/smart-contracts/contract-reference#decoder-contract)

### Passport (Stamp) attestation schema

The raw schema looks as follows:

```
uint256[] providers, bytes32[] hashes, uint64[] issuanceDates, uint64[] expirationDates, uint16 providerMapVersion
```

Notice that the types for all these fields are numerical types or raw bytes. 
This is because the human-readable information is compressed and encoded before being added to the attestation.

You can see an example of a Stamp attestation on the Optimism network by visiting the following link:

[Example Passport (Stamp) attestation on Optimism](https://optimism.easscan.org/attestation/view/0xd53526d72b9e9283a70894ddfba32513b722a939d85c1a6be402416d29cdc0b9)

#### Fields

The fields are as follows:

- `providers`: a u256 that is actually a bitmap where each position maps to a provider name. The mapping is made available offchain.
- `hashes`: an ordered array of elements, with each element being 32 raw bytes. Each element in the array is a 32-byte hash that maps to a known Stamp. A provider might have multiple Stamps that each have a hash. The mapping is made available offchain.
- `issuanceDates`: an ordered array of elements, with each element being 32 raw bytes. Each element represents the UNIX timestamp when the Stamp was verified.
- `expirationDates`: an ordered array of elements, with each element being 32 raw bytes. Each element represents the UNIX timestamp when the Stamp expires.
- `providerMapVersion`: an unsigned integer specifying which version of the `providers` mapping the Attestation conforms to. This allows updates as providers are added and removed from the canonical set.


### Score attestation schema

The raw schema looks as follows:

```
uint256 score, uint32 scorer_id, uint8 score_decimals
```

You can see an example of a score attestation on the Optimism network by visiting the following link:

[Example score attestation on Optimism](https://optimism.easscan.org/attestation/view/0x1d7832d2f4e5e71da3d8b0ceee72faf4cd44990057b21a26d9f775b911fe1bfe)

#### Fields

The fields are as follows:

- `score`: the user's Passport score as an unsigned integer
- `scorer_id`: the ID number for the specific Scorer instance that issued the `score`
- `score_decimals`: number of decimals in `score`, similar to how ETH is divided into 1e18 Wei.
