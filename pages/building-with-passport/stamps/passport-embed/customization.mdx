# Passport Embed - Customization

The Passport Embed widget is fully themeable, allowing you to match its appearance to your application’s design system. You can customize colors, fonts, border radius, padding, transition timing, and z-index positioning.

## Using Built-in Themes

Passport Embed provides two built-in themes: `DarkTheme` and `LightTheme`. You can import them from the package and pass them directly to the widget’s theme prop.

```jsx
import { PassportScoreWidget, DarkTheme, LightTheme } from "@passportxyz/passport-embed";

<PassportScoreWidget
  apiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
  scorerId="<YOUR_SCORER_ID>"
  generateSignatureCallback={generateSignature}
  theme={DarkTheme} // or LightTheme
/>
```

If your app supports dynamic theming, you can toggle between these based on the user’s preference:

```jsx
const theme = isDarkMode ? DarkTheme : LightTheme;
```

These built-in themes provide a solid foundation and follow best practices for accessibility and contrast.

### Extending or Overriding Theme Properties

You can also override specific theme values by spreading one of the defaults and replacing the properties you’d like to change:

```jsx
const customTheme = {
  ...DarkTheme,
  colors: {
    ...DarkTheme.colors,
    primary: "255, 255, 0"
  }
};
```

## Full Theme Schema

Here are the available fields in the PassportWidgetTheme object:

```jsx
export type PassportWidgetTheme = {
  colors?: {
    primary?: string;
    secondary?: string;
    background?: string;
    success?: string;
    failure?: string;
  };
  padding?: {
    widget?: {
      x?: string;
      y?: string;
    };
  };
  radius?: {
    widget?: string;
    button?: string;
  };
  transition?: {
    speed?: string;
  };
  font?: {
    family?: {
      body?: string;
      heading?: string;
      alt?: string;
    };
  };
  position?: {
    overlayZIndex?: string;
  };
};
```

All values are optional. If a field is not specified, the default from the base theme (Dark or Light) will be used.

### Tips

Tips

* Theme values such as colors.primary must be in RGB format: for example, `"255, 255, 0"`.
* Font families must match fonts already loaded on the page.
* `overlayZIndex` is only used in `collapseMode="overlay"`.
* Use `transition.speed` to adjust animation timing (for example, `"0.3s"`).


### Example

```jsx
<PassportScoreWidget
  apiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
  scorerId="<YOUR_SCORER_ID>"
  generateSignatureCallback={generateSignature}
  theme={{
    colors: { primary: "34, 197, 94", background: "255, 255, 255" },
    font: { family: { body: "Inter, sans-serif" } },
    radius: { widget: "12px", button: "8px" },
    transition: { speed: "0.2s" }
  }}
/>
```

## Next Step

Once your theme is set, head over to the [Component Reference](component-reference) to see all other available props.
