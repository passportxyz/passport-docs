# Passport Embed

## Introduction

Passport Embeds is a premium offering that lets websites integrate Human Passport's [Stamps-based verification](/building-with-passport/stamps/introduction) directly on their website or app, eliminating the need for users to be redirected elsewhere​. In essence, Passport Embeds provides an on-site widget for proof of humanity, ensuring that communities and applications remain Sybil-resistant (protected from fake or duplicate accounts) without adding user friction.

Core Benefits:
* **Frictionless User Experience:** Users can verify their identity within your app or site (no external redirects), leading to higher conversion and less drop-off​. The verification process is quick and preserves privacy, requiring only a crypto wallet and approved credentials rather than personal data.
* **Powerful Sybil Protection:** Backed by the Human Passport scoring system, it effectively distinguishes real users from bots. You can gate content or features based on Passport scores (for example, only users above a certain score can access an airdrop) to keep out malicious actors​.
* **Targeted for Web3 Communities:** Ideal for dApps, DAOs, forums, or any platform where one-person-one-account is vital. It enables ecosystems to protect and grow their communities organically by ensuring each participant is unique​.
* **Key Differentiators:** Passport Embeds is a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional KYC or CAPTCHA. It uses verifiable credentials (“Stamps”) to calculate a trust score, so site owners never receive sensitive personal info – only a score or pass/fail status. Unlike other solutions, Passport Embeds is decentralized and user-first​, meaning users maintain control over their data and can prove their humanity without sacrificing anonymity.

Overall, the Passport Embeds widget brings the power of Human Passport’s identity verification directly into your application. It’s designed for both developers and decision-makers who want to boost security and trust in their platform while keeping the user experience seamless and on-brand.
