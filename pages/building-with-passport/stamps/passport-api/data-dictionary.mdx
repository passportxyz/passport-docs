# Data dictionary (v2)

On this page you will find definitions and explanations for the data types used in the Human Passport stack. The `Scorer`, `Stamp` , `Credential` and `Stamp-metadata` objects require the most explanation so they are handled separately here.

### The Scorer object

| Value                  | Type                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | How to use                                                                                                                                          |

| `address`              | String (hexadecimal address)                | The `string` of 20 bytes that uniquely identify an Ethereum account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Identifies a specific account to which the payload's data relates.                                                                                  |
| `score`                | String (numeric value as a string)          | The `registry/score` endpoint returns a `string` that should be parsed as a `float`. It represents the result of adding the weights of all a user's Stamps.                                                                                                                                                                                      | If you'd like to use your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx), you can compare this score against that threshold to identify which users should be provided access.       |
| `passing_score`        | Boolean                                     | Passing score will return either `true` or `false` as its value, depending on whether the user's score exceeded the `threshold` score of `20`, as recommended by the Passport team. You can also choose your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx) and use the `score` value if you'd prefer.                          | If you'd like to use the Passport recommended score threshold, you can use this value to identify which users should be provided access.            |
| `last_score_timestamp` | String (ISO 8601 datetime)                  | The date and time of the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Can be used to identify when the snapshot of this data occured.                                                                                     |
| `expiration_timestamp` | String (ISO 8601 datetime)                  | The date and time that the next Stamp will expire, which will subsequently reduce the `score`. To see when each specific Stamp expires, please use the [GET /v2/stamps\{address\}](api-reference#retrieve-stamps-verified-by-a-single-address) endpoint.                                                                                         | You might want to display this score expiration to the user to remind them to return to the Passport app to refresh their score before it expires   |
| `threshold`            | String (numeric value as a string)          | The Passport recommended score threshold that the user's score must exceed to be considered passing. The current recommended threshold is `20`. You can also choose your own [score threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds.mdx) and use the `score` value if you'd prefer.                                                              | If you'd like to use the Passport recommended score threshold, you can use this value to identify which users should be provided access.            |
| `error`                | String                                      | Describes any error returned by the server. Refer to the API [status and error codes page](status-and-error-codes) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Can be used to understand why a request failed.                                                                                                     |
| `stamps`               | Object                                      | Contains simplified credential objects for each [credential](../major-concepts/credential-map-and-weights.mdx) that has been validated by the specified user. This object was introduced on December 29th, 2023, and is not available via the historical score endpoint before this point.                                                                                                     | The included credential objects within this object are the credentials that the user has verified.                                        |
| `stamps.<credential_name>.score`              | String (numeric value as a string)      | The specific weight, or score, that this verified [credential](../major-concepts/credential-map-and-weights.mdx) contributes to your overall unique humanity score, or `score`, above.<br /><br /> If this specific credential is deduped, this score will be zero (0).                                                                                                     | Can be used to understand how the overall unique humanity score was calculated.                                                                     |
| `stamps.<credential_name>.dedup`              | Boolean                                 | If this specific credential has been [deduplicated](../major-concepts/deduplicating-stamps.mdx) (in other words, if this same credential has been verified by another address), this boolean will come back as `true`.<br /><br />IF `true`, the credential's score will be zero (0) and the credential's expiration date will represent when the credential verified by the other address will expire, rather than when this credential will expire.                | This information can be used both to identify why a user's score is lower than expected and to publicly communicate these reasons to the user.      |
| `stamps.<credential_name>.expiration_date`    | String (ISO 8601 datetime)              | Notes when this specific credential will expire.<br /><br /> If this specific credential is deduped, this expiration date will represent when the credential verified by the other address will expire, rather than when this credential will expire.                                                                         | This information can be displayed to users to help them understand when their credential will expire.                                               |

#### Credentials

A `credential` is a object returned in the Stamp object. [Learn more about Verifiable Credentials via their w3 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
