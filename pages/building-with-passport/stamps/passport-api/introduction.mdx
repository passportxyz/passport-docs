# Stamps API v2

Passport Stamps is an aggregate, real-time verification tool that can enable users to prove their unique humanity using a variety of different verification methods, and for developers to access these humanity proofs via the Stamps API or [smart contracts](/building-with-passport/stamps/smart-contracts).

Users can prove their humanity using Passport Stamps by visiting the [Passport App](https://app.passport.xyz) and completing a verification flow, or by using the [Passport Embed](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-embed) widget on a partner website or dApp.

## Why use the API

The Stamps API offers a simple integration; one that requires just one request to receive users' Stamp-based Unique Humanity Score and associated metadata. This data is retrieved from the centralized Human Passport servers, meaning it is the most up-to-date data available for Human Passport users. 

All Passport Stamps user data can be accessed via the Stamps API, whereas only a portion of users' have minted their Passport onchain, making it available via our [smart contracts](/building-with-passport/stamps/smart-contracts).

### Example flow

An excellent [use case](/overview/use-cases) for Human Passport is to protect access to a reward or governance program. To make this happen, follow these steps:

1. [Creating a Passport Project/Scorer and API key](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/getting-access)
2. Retrieve a user's Passport score and Stamp data using the [GET /v2/stamps/\{scorer_id\}/score/\{address\}](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/api-reference#retrieve-latest-score-for-a-single-address) endpoint. 
3. Find the user's Unique Humanity Score or `passing_score` within the returned data. 
3. Compare the Unique Humanity Score against a [threshold](/building-with-passport/stamps/major-concepts/scoring-thresholds) that you set, or utilize the binary `passing_score` field that uses our recommended threshold of 20. 

If a user was able to build up a score greater than this threshold, they've effectively proven their humanity and you can grant access to the protected program.
