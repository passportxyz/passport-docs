# Stamps API v2

The Stamps API serves as a powerful tool for developers, offering access to Passport's Stamp-based score metadata using REST endpoints.

## Why use the API

The API offers a simple integration; one that requires just two requests to submit and request user Human Passport data. This data is retrieved from the centralized Human Passport servers, meaning it is the most up-to-date data available for Human Passport users. 

### Example flow

An excellent [use case](/overview/use-cases) for Human Passport is to protect access to a reward or governance program. To make this happen, follow these steps:

1. [Creating a Passport Project/Scorer and API key](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/getting-access)
2. Retrieve a user's Passport score and Stamp data using the [GET /v2/stamps/\{scorer_id\}/score/\{address\}](/building-with-passport/stamps/passport-api/api-reference#retrieve-latest-score-for-a-single-address) endpoint. 
3. Find the user's Unique Humanity Score or `passing_score` within the returned data. 
3. Compare the Unique Humanity Score against a [threshold](/building-with-passport/stamps/major-concepts/scoring-thresholds) that you set, or utilize the binary `passing_score` field that uses our recommended threshold of 20. 

If a user was able to build up a score greater than this threshold, they've effectively proven their humanity and you can grant access to the protected program.
