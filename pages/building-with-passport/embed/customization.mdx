# Passport Embed - Customization

The Passport Embed component is fully themeable, allowing you to match its appearance to your application's design system. You can customize colors, fonts, border radius, padding, transition timing, and z-index positioning.

## Collapse Mode

With Passport Embed, you can control the component’s **collapsible behavior** and how it is displayed relative to your page layout. 

There are three options for collapse mode:
* **`"shift"`** (default): the component is embedded in the flow and expanding it will push/shift surrounding content (useful if placing at top of a page, for example).
* **`"overlay"`**: the component will overlay on top of content when expanded (using CSS `position:absolute` or similar, on top of the page, with an overlay background perhaps – the `overlayZIndex` theme can be used to adjust stacking).
* **`"off"`**: collapse functionality is disabled; the component is always fully expanded (use this if you want the full component visible at all times in a particular spot).

You can experiment with these modes to see which best fits your UI. 

## Using Built-in Themes

Passport Embed provides two built-in themes: `DarkTheme` and `LightTheme`. You can import them from the package and pass them directly to the component’s theme prop. By default, the component will use `DarkTheme`.

```jsx
import { PassportScorecomponent, DarkTheme, LightTheme } from "@human.tech/passport-embed";

<PassportScorecomponent
  apiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
  scorerId="<YOUR_SCORER_ID>"
  generateSignatureCallback={generateSignature}
  theme={DarkTheme} // or LightTheme
/>
```

If your app supports dynamic theming, you can toggle between these based on the user's preference:

```jsx
const theme = isDarkMode ? DarkTheme : LightTheme;
```

These built-in themes provide a solid foundation and follow best practices for accessibility and contrast.

### Extending or Overriding Theme Properties

You can also override specific theme values by spreading one of the defaults and replacing the properties you'd like to change:

```jsx
const customTheme = {
  ...DarkTheme,
  colors: {
    ...DarkTheme.colors,
    primary: "255, 255, 0"
  }
};
```

### Full Theme Schema

The PassportcomponentTheme object lets you customize the look and feel of the component.

All fields are optional — if a value is not specified, the defaults from the selected base theme (DarkTheme or LightTheme) will be used.

```jsx
export type PassportcomponentTheme = {
  colors?: {
    primary?: string;
    secondary?: string;
    background?: string;
    success?: string;
    failure?: string;
  };
  padding?: {
    component?: {
      x?: string;
      y?: string;
    };
  };
  radius?: {
    component?: string;
    button?: string;
  };
  transition?: {
    speed?: string;
  };
  font?: {
    family?: {
      body?: string;
      heading?: string;
      alt?: string;
    };
  };
  position?: {
    overlayZIndex?: string;
  };
};
```

### Tips & Requirements
* `colors.*` must be defined using RGB format — for example: "255, 255, 0" (Hex codes and named colors are not supported)
* Font families must reference fonts that are already loaded on the page, except for the component defaults
* `overlayZIndex` is only applied when `collapseMode` is set to `overlay`
* Use `transition.speed` to fine-tune component animation timing (e.g. `0.2s`, `0.5s`)
* All values are optional — anything you omit will fall back to the base theme


### Example

```jsx
<PassportScorecomponent
  apiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
  scorerId="<YOUR_SCORER_ID>"
  generateSignatureCallback={generateSignature}
  theme={{
    colors: { primary: "34, 197, 94", background: "255, 255, 255" },
    font: { family: { body: "Inter, sans-serif" } },
    radius: { component: "12px", button: "8px" },
    transition: { speed: "0.2s" }
  }}
/>
```

## Next Step

Once your theme is set, head over to the [Component Reference](component-reference) to see all other available props, or check out our [sample application](https://passport-sample-embed-demo.vercel.app) to see customization in action.
