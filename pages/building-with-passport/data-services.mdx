# Passport Data Services

Human Passport’s Data Services provide advanced, ML-driven Sybil detection and wallet analysis, helping partners confidently distinguish genuine users from Sybil attackers.

## Overview

Passport’s Data Services offer batch analysis of wallet addresses, designed specifically for scenarios where you have a predefined list of addresses (such as airdrops, event registrations, or community campaigns). It complements Passport’s real-time verification tools like [Passport API](/building-with-passport/passport-api) and [smart contract-based verification](/building-with-passport/smart-contracts).

## Use Cases

Common scenarios where Passport’s Data Services deliver significant value include:

* **Airdrops and Token Distributions**: Vet wallet addresses before distributing tokens to ensure only legitimate users receive rewards.
* **Community Campaign Audits**: Identify bot-driven farming in referral campaigns, growth initiatives, or contests.
* **Sybil Attack Investigations**: Assess and remediate suspected Sybil activities post-event or campaign.

## How It Works

The process is straightforward and collaborative:

### 1. Submit Your Wallet List

Securely share the wallet addresses you want analyzed.

### 2. Advanced Analysis

Passport’s data team conducts comprehensive analysis, including:

* **ML-based Sybil Classification**: Our machine learning models analyze wallet transaction patterns across multiple chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, zkSync), assigning a Unique Humanity Score from 0-100.
* **Sybil Clustering Analysis**: Detect related wallets based on funding patterns, behavior similarities, and transaction clustering.
* **Low-Activity Wallet Handling**: Special handling and heuristics for wallets with minimal activity, ensuring fair evaluation without compromising security.
* **Expert Consultation**: Human analysts review findings, validate results, and provide tailored insights and recommendations.

### 3. Actionable Reports

Receive detailed reports with clear classification, identified Sybil clusters, actionable recommendations, and guidance on implementation.

### 4. Ongoing Support (Optional)

Continuous monitoring and periodic analyses for long-term campaigns or community management.
