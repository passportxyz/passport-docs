# Passport API v2 -- API Reference

<Callout type="info">
**Please note:**<br />Passport API v2 simplifies and adds key functionality that wasn't previously available with [Passport API v1](../passport-api-v1/overview). Because of this, it is recommended for you to use Passport API v2 moving forward.<br /><br />We have not announced any deprecation or retirement timelines for v1 yet, and plan to provide more details before the end of 2024.<br /><br />You can learn more about the differences between v1 and v2 via our [migration guide](migrate).
</Callout>

The Passport API enables developers to retrieve Human Passport scores and Stamp metadata for users who have created a Passport.

You can also experiment with the Passport API using our [API playground tool](https://api.passport.xyz/v2/docs) and adding your API keys via the 'Authorize' button.

In the examples below, replace the following placeholder values with your actual data:
- `{scorer_id}` - Your Scorer ID from the developer portal
- `{address}` - The Ethereum address you want to score
- `{API_key}` - Your API key from the developer portal


## Authentication

To access the Passport API, you will need a [Scorer ID and an API key](getting-access).

To make a successful request, you will need to include your API key in the "Authorization" header of each API request. The header should have the following format:

```
"X-API-KEY: {API_key}"
```

Replace `{API_key}` with your API key. For example, if you were using cURL, your request might look something like this:

```bash
curl --request GET 'https://api.passport.xyz/v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address}' \
    --header 'X-API-KEY: VwUi___.0yQU1HIAE4hLEMkVs___'
```

## Rate limits

Your API key will allow you to make up to a certain number of requests to any of the endpoints included on this page during a certain period of time.

Requests made to the Passport API v1 and v2 count towards the same rate limit.

Access starts with Tier 1. If you need an elevation, please [request higher rate limits](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUATg0nTE9ws3qESGBktFcOX0brF19iv2L0BLoiub9pbSMeg/viewform).

| Tier   | Rate limit                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | 125 requests per 15 minutes   |
| Tier 2 | 350 requests per 15 minutes   |
| Tier 3 | 2000 requests per 15 minutes  |
| Tier 4 | 2000+ requests per 15 minutes |


## Key concepts

There are several key concepts you should be aware of when using the Passport API:

* **Timeouts:** The Passport API endpoints have a timeout of 60 seconds. This means that if a request to one of these endpoints does not receive a response within 60 seconds, the request will be aborted. If your request times out, you should set up retry logic by calling the API again after a short delay, typically increasing the delay for each subsequent retry.
* **Pagination:** Some requests return a large amount of data. To effectively retrieve this data, you will need to paginate the response. For more information, see [API pagination](/building-with-passport/major-concepts/api-pagination).
* **Data dictionary:** For definitions of the data types used in Passport API v2, see the [Data dictionary](data-dictionary) page.

### Retrieve latest score for a single address

This is the primary endpoint that integrators should use.

This endpoint will return the latest score and Stamp data for a single address.

> GET /v2/stamps/\{scorer_id\}/score/\{address\}

```bash filename="Sample request" copy
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.passport.xyz/v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address} \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: {API KEY}'
``` 

```json filename="Sample response"
{
  "address": "{address}",
  "score": "{overall_score}",
  "passing_score": true/false,
  "last_score_timestamp": "{last_score_time ISO 8601}",
  "expiration_timestamp": "{expiration_time ISO 8601}",
  "threshold": "20",
  "error": null,
  "stamps": {
    "Ens": {
      "score": "{credential_score}",
      "dedup": true/false,
      "expiration_date": "{expiration_time ISO 8601}"
    },
    "ETHDaysActive#50": {

### Retrieve historical score for a single address

<Callout type="info">
**Note:**<br />To access this endpoint, you must submit your use case and be approved by the Passport team. To do so, please fill out the following form, making sure to provide a detailed description of your use case. The Passport team typically reviews and responds to form responses within 48 hours.<br /><br />[Request access](https://forms.gle/4GyicBfhtHW29eEu8)
</Callout>

This endpoint will return the last requested historical score and Stamp data for a single address before a specified time. 

For example, if you requested a score on 2024-12-01 using the `GET /v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address}` endpoint, then use this historical score endpoint to request the score for the same address on 2024-12-05, you will receive the score and Stamp data for 2024-12-01 for that address. If you have not requested a score for a specified address using the `GET /v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address}` endpoint, you will not be able to receive a historical score for that address. 


> GET /v2/stamps/\{scorer_id\}/score/\{address\}/history
