## Where to start

To take your very first steps into building apps with Gitcoin Passport, you can visit either the [API access](getting-access) page, followed by the [Quick Start guide](quick-start-guide).

## Tutorials

### Gating access with Passport scores

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple "knowledge hub" app with some specific content that can only be accessed by users with a Passport score above a threshold.
Read more about thresholds on the [scoring thresholds](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds) page.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

### Integrating Stamps and scores

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple app that shows whether a user is "trusted" or not based upon their Passport score and ownership of specific Stamps. Multiple users can connect to the app and the Stamps they own are displayed in the app's UI.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

### How to integrate onchain Passport data using smart contracts

_Please note that this tutorial is not related to the Passport API, and instead uses the Passport smart contract stack._

This tutorial will guide you how to show different content to users depending on their Passport data, all pulled from the blockchain.

The app is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).
