# Getting Access: Scorer ID and API Key

The Passport API provides programmatic access to a wallet's Passport score. Once you have your API key, you need to include it with each request you make to the API. This allows Human Passport to identify your app and verify that you are authorized to access the API.

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Log in to the developer portal:** Go to [developer.passport.xyz](https://developer.passport.xyz) and log in to your account by connecting your wallet.
2. **Navigate to the API Keys section:** After logging in, go to the "API Keys" section.
3. **Generate an API key:** Click on the "+ Create a Key" button to generate a unique API key for your account.
4. **Store your API key securely:** Store your API key in a secure place, as it will be used to access the Passport API.


### Getting your Scorer ID
A Scorer is an developer element that can be used to organize different use cases. You need to create a Scorer and associated Scorer ID to be able to request user data via the Passport API. If you are using the Passport API in multiple use cases, you should set up separate Scorers for each one.

<Callout type="warning">
For the time being, please make sure you are selecting the Unique Humanity Scorer, and not the Binary Scorer. We will be deprecating these different Scorer types soon.<br /><br />If you have already selected the Binary Scorer, please disregard the v2 `threshold` and `passing_score` fields, as they are currently not correct. We will be updating all Binary Scorers to the new format soon.
