# Introduction

If you’re a Gitcoin Passport user interested in setting up a Passport and connecting Stamps to it, head to our [support site](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/what-is-gitcoin-passport) for more info.

## What is Passport?

Passport is a tool that allows users to present evidence that they are real, unique humans and signal their trustworthiness to apps. It is a way to collect and present data without exposing it or giving up ownership. 

Under the hood, it is a unique decentralized identifier (a DID) associated with your Ethereum address, stored on the Ceramic network. 

The DID can be used to look up a user's Stamp data, which exists as a collection of Verified Credentials.

**Verified Credentials do not contain any personal identifying information!** They simply demonstrate, using a cryptographic signature, that the user gave access to a specific app and that some criteria were met.

## Use cases

Developers can integrate Passport in a variety of different programs and apps in the web3 ecosystem, as demonstrated by the following use case examples:

- Sybil resistance for faucets, bundlers and airdrops
- Gating access to content, events, polls, or communities
- Priority weighting votes
- Proving trustworthiness

Passport is a versatile and valuable tool for managing access, promoting transparency, and establishing trust within different web3 environments.

## Available developer tools

Passport score and Stamp data can be retrieved in two ways:

* **Passport API:** Retrieves data associated with a specific address from the Gitcoin server. 
* **Passport Smart Contracts:** Interacts with a blockchain to retrieve data associated with a specific address. 

### Passport API

The Passport API serves as a powerful tool for developers, offering access to Passport scores and Stamps via several REST endpoints.

### Smart contracts

Passport's smart contracts enable you to pull score and Stamp data directly from the blockchain to enable a truly decentralized integration.

### ComposeDB

ComposeDB is available as a developer tool. ComposeDB is a decentralized graph database built on top of Ceramic. 
Being a product built on top of Ceramic, ComposeDB provides many benefits for web3 native applications including strong Ethereum integrations. 


There is also a rich, Graph-QL style API that helps developers to construct complex queries. 
These are very useful features for Gitcoin Passport.


ComposeDB allows us to create and publish data schemas that work across different tech-stacks, meaning we can deploy apps that work identically across multiple layer-1 blockchains and their layer-2's. 
Data on ComposeDB is updateable allowing, for example, Stamp expiry and reverification.

### GTC Staking endpoint

Passport's GTC staking endpoint enables developers to analyze and build with GTC staking data.

With this endpoint, developers should build solutions that help increase the amount of GTC staked on trusted entities, effectively growing the GTC trust graph.

## Getting Started

To begin your development journey with Passport API, follow these steps:

- [Get access to the API](getting-access)
- [Use the API playground tool (requires API keys)](https://api.scorer.gitcoin.co/docs)
- [Get to "Hello World" with the API](quick-start-guide)
- [Choose a tutorial that best matches your use case. Review the example code and integrate](tutorials)

By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to start integrating Passport into your platform.
