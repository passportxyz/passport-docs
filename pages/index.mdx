# Gitcoin Passport Docs

The citizenship pass for the decentralized internet.

Gitcoin Passport is an identity verification application and Sybil resistance protocol. 
It enables users to collect [verifiable credentials](/overview/key-terms#verifiable-credentials-vcs), or Stamps, that prove their identity and trustworthiness without exposing personally identifying information. Apps and organizations can then utilize Passport to protect their community and projects from sybil attacks and other bad actors.

These developer docs describe the Passport API and smart contract stack you can use to build Passport into your app, as well as the criteria and process of becoming a Stamp partner.
