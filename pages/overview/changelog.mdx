# Changelog

## March 12th, 2025

We made several updates to Onchain Passport based on developer feedback.

- We have reduced the number of onchain attestations that we write for users from two to just one. 
- We have updated the [Onchain Passport attestation schema](/building-with-passport/smart-contracts/attestation-schema) to be more developer-friendly.
- We have deprecated the hash that was returned with the decoder contract's `getPassport` method.
- We've introduced a new method, `getScore` (0xdaadd662), which accepts a scorer ID (communityID) and user address, and returns the current score of a user for that scorer. This can be used by partners who are using [custom scores](/building-with-passport/stamps/custom-passport). At this time, there is no way to request Stamp-specific Custom Passport data from onchain. 

## Context
