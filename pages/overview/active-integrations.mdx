## Guild.xyz

[Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/explorer) is a the infrastructure for platformless access management. Create portable memberships, social structures around on- & off-chain requirements and build unique user journeys across apps.

It's a great tool to gate access to Discord roles, Telegram channels, and more. 

You can use a certain Passport score threshold as a requirement to gain access to your community tools.

## Discourse

Discourse is an open source Internet forum system that is used as a governance tool for many web3 organizations. 

You've got a few different opportunities to use Passport to assign roles and gate access! 

There are actually two different plugins that you can use with Discourse! We are more impressed with the level of documentation provided by Dappy.lol though.

## Collab.land

Collab.Land is a community management tool that supports a wide range of projects, including DAOs, NFT communities, brands, and creators of all sizes.

As with any community management tool, roles are critical for providing different levels of access. The Collab.Land integration allows you to gate access to roles to just those users who can prove their humanity on Passport!
