### Protect access: Rewards

#### Sub use cases
* Quadratic funding matching donation pools
* NFTs 
* Airdrops
* Faucets
* Quests
* Special access

#### Description
One of the primary reasons why Sybils exist is to take advantage of community rewards programs. Whether you’re offering NFTs, airdrops, faucets, or other incentives programs, you want to make sure that your rewards are going to just those humans that deserve it. 

By protecting access to Passport holders that have a score over a certain [threshold](../major-concepts/scoring-thresholds), you are ensuring that your community rewards programs are properly distributed.

![proving reputation](../../public/prove-reputation.png)

### Prove reputation

#### Sub use cases
* Demonstrate user trustworthiness
* Prove user activity on web2/3
